# Return values

# Suppose we want to do some data analysis.
# Eventually, I want to print the STANDARD DEVIATION of a set of numbers.
# In other words, if I have a set of numbers like this:

 array = [93, 65, 87, 68, 2, 64, 36, 96, 45, 47]

# Then I want to be able to do something like this:

#     stdev1 = standard_deviation(first_dataset)

# And have it work.

# In order to find the STANDARD DEVIATIONS of sets of numbers, we have
# to be able to find VARIANCES. In order to find VARIANCES, we have to be
# able to find SUMS and MEANS.

# So, let us first define some tools that will be helpful in taking the
# intermediate steps:

# SUM
# ===
# To find the sum of a set of numbers,
#  - we start with 0
#  - for each number in the set,
#   - we add it to the running total
#  - after we've looked at every number, the running total is the sum




#def sum(list_of_numbers)
=begin
	
rescue Exception => e
	
end
 running_total = 0
 
list_of_numbers.each do |number|

    running_total = running_total + number
  end

  return running_total
end

puts sum(array)
puts mean(array)

=end
